      <h1>Welcome to Clearwater Kayak Outfitters!</h1>
      <article id="intro">
        <p>Clearwater Kayak Outfitters offers guided day tours, wildlife encounter tours, marsh tours, fishing tours, sunset and moonlight tours, and overnight tours. If you&rsquo;re an experienced kayaker, you can also rent a kayak at an hourly or daily rate and go out to explore on your own. Plus, we host special travel packages twice a year for more extreme whitewater kayaking adventures. </p>
        <p> Day trips are limited to 20 people, so reservations are highly recommended (especially on weekends or holidays). For larger groups, please contact us to schedule a private group tour.</p>
        <p> Overnight tours are limited to 16 people based on the available space in the designated camping locations. </p>
        <p> To experience the natural beauty of central Florida&rsquo;s waterways, call us 866-555-1234 for reservations. </p>

        <h2>Do I need experience?</h2>
        <p> All of our daily tours are suitable for any level of experience, from beginners to advanced kayakers. Please be aware that kayaking is a physical activity, so some exertion will be required. Most day trips take between 2 and 3 hours, and cover approximately 2 miles.</p>
        <p> Overnight tours are not recommended for first-time kayakers, although you do not need extensive experience to enjoy this experience. </p>
        <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
        <p> Kayaks and safety equipment (life jackets, helmets) are included in the cost of the tour. Feel free to bring binoculars and cameras, although we recommend keeping them in a waterproof bag (available at the launch-site store).</p>
        <p> You may bring snacks, but please remember to keep your trash with you until it can be properly disposed of when the tour returns to the launch site. Drinks should be in plastic bottles; glass bottles and alcoholic beverages are not allowed.</p>
        <p> A hat, sunglasses, bug spray, and sunscreen are highly recommended for day tours. For sunset and moonlight tours, a jacket or other warm clothing are recommended.</p>
        <p> For overnight tours, you must bring your own sleeping bags/blankets and toiletries; those will be transported to the camp site for you. Warm clothing is recommended once the sun goes down. Dinner is provided when we reach the camp site, but you may bring your own snacks as well.</p>
        <h2> What about children?</h2>
        <p> Children at least 6 years old are welcome on day tours when accompanied by an adult. (Anyone under 18  is required to wear a provided life jacket and helmet during the entire trip. These are also available and recommended—but not required—for adults.)</p>
        <p> Overnight tours are limited to children 12  and older, when accompanied by an adult.</p>
        <p> Whitewater travel packages are limited to experienced kayakers 18 years or older, and require reservations at least one month in advance of the scheduled trip date. These always fill up quickly, so make your reservations early!</p>
