			<h4>Chapter 1 - Web Research</h4>
			<p>A) How did the W3C get started?
			<br><br>- The W3C was founded in 1994, right after the creation of the World Wide Web in 1989 by a man named Tim Berners-Lee. This creation was possible through the means of bringing together stake-holders and developing strong business processes. 
			<br><br>B) Who can join the W3C? What does it cost to join?
			<br><br>- Anyone is able to join the membership of W3C, even for commercial, governmental, and educational entities. As long as they are able to sign the Membership Agreement, then that person may enter as a member. Members can be from either for profit or non profit organizations. The actual fee for gaining a W3C membership can range variangly to the size and location of the company. For instance, a miniature company in India would pay around 1900 USD, annually. Where as a huge company in France could cost up to 60,000 EUR, annually. 
			<br><br>C) Data Technology (3 facts or issues)
			
			<br><br>- A major shift from traditional graph technologies, such as: SQL, RDBMS, CVS, and PDF files to graph data with nodes and labeled links between them has created an environment where:
			<br>- Much faster performance than SQL and JOIN operations
			<br>- Better performance when data models are constantly changing
			<br>- Easier to import data sets from diverse data sets
			
			<br><br>A) Why was the internet society created?
			<br><br>- The Internet Society was created in order to promote an open internet for the use of free development, creation, and general usage of the internet to benefit people all around the world. 
			<br><br>B) List a website and its service it provides
			<br><br>- This website, www.sfbayisoc.org/, provides information about the conference meetings that are held at the location in San diego. These discussions incorpoate heavy thought into IPv6 and DNSSEC to system administration, DevOps, engineering, enterprise computing, and research computing. 
			<br><br>C) How can you join? What does it cost? Would a beginner in Web Development join the internet society? Why?
			<br><br>- You can join by finding a specific chapter location and entering from the website. There are no costs to join the San Francisco Internet Society. It would be best for a beginner in Web Development to join the Internet Society because it can help teach you the reason why keeping the internet for the use of all is so significant to our everyday lives. 
			<br><br>A) Who developed HTTP/2?
			<br><br>- HTTP was originally developed by Google, which was the language derived by HTTP/2. HTTP/2 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force.
			<br><br>B) When was the HTTP/2 proposed standard published?
			<br><br>- The very first proposal of HTTP/2 was made to the IESG for the purpose of making them consider the new technology as a proposed standard during December, 2014. It wasn't until February 17, 2015, when IESG approved of the Proposed Standard.
			<br><br>C) Three methods used by HTTP/2 to reduce latency and provide quicker loading time?
			<br><br>- In order for latency to reduce, the header size had to be shrunk down to a smaller size. HTTP/2 also comes with full request and response multiplexing, meaning that the limitations of having to create multiple TCP connections for better performance are now removed. It also supports better server push and request prioritization.
