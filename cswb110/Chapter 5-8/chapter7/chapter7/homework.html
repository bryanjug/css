				<h4>Chapter 1 - Web Research</h4>
				<p>A) How did the W3C get started?
				<br><br>- The W3C was founded in 1994, right after the creation of the World Wide Web in 1989 by a man named Tim Berners-Lee. This creation was possible through the means of bringing together stake-holders and developing strong business processes. 
				<br><br>B) Who can join the W3C? What does it cost to join?
				<br><br>- Anyone is able to join the membership of W3C, even for commercial, governmental, and educational entities. As long as they are able to sign the Membership Agreement, then that person may enter as a member. Members can be from either for profit or non profit organizations. The actual fee for gaining a W3C membership can range variangly to the size and location of the company. For instance, a miniature company in India would pay around 1900 USD, annually. Where as a huge company in France could cost up to 60,000 EUR, annually. 
				<br><br>C) Data Technology (3 facts or issues)
				
				<br><br>- A major shift from traditional graph technologies, such as: SQL, RDBMS, CVS, and PDF files to graph data with nodes and labeled links between them has created an environment where:
				<br>- Much faster performance than SQL and JOIN operations
				<br>- Better performance when data models are constantly changing
				<br>- Easier to import data sets from diverse data sets
				
				<br><br>A) Why was the internet society created?
				<br><br>- The Internet Society was created in order to promote an open internet for the use of free development, creation, and general usage of the internet to benefit people all around the world. 
				<br><br>B) List a website and its service it provides
				<br><br>- This website, www.sfbayisoc.org/, provides information about the conference meetings that are held at the location in San diego. These discussions incorpoate heavy thought into IPv6 and DNSSEC to system administration, DevOps, engineering, enterprise computing, and research computing. 
				<br><br>C) How can you join? What does it cost? Would a beginner in Web Development join the internet society? Why?
				<br><br>- You can join by finding a specific chapter location and entering from the website. There are no costs to join the San Francisco Internet Society. It would be best for a beginner in Web Development to join the Internet Society because it can help teach you the reason why keeping the internet for the use of all is so significant to our everyday lives. 
				<br><br>A) Who developed HTTP/2?
				<br><br>- HTTP was originally developed by Google, which was the language derived by HTTP/2. HTTP/2 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force.
				<br><br>B) When was the HTTP/2 proposed standard published?
				<br><br>- The very first proposal of HTTP/2 was made to the IESG for the purpose of making them consider the new technology as a proposed standard during December, 2014. It wasn't until February 17, 2015, when IESG approved of the Proposed Standard.
				<br><br>C) Three methods used by HTTP/2 to reduce latency and provide quicker loading time?
				<br><br>- In order for latency to reduce, the header size had to be shrunk down to a smaller size. HTTP/2 also comes with full request and response multiplexing, meaning that the limitations of having to create multiple TCP connections for better performance are now removed. It also supports better server push and request prioritization.

				<h4>Chapter 5 - Write Up</h4>
				<p>
				1. What type of site organization is used for the JavaJam website? Is it the most appropriate organization for the site? Why or why not?
				</p>
				<p>
				The first and main method used to create the JavaJam website was the implementation of a site map. This specific site map constructed where exactly each file should be placed within a file system. As for the JavaJam Case, we were to develop a webpage that uses a single main page, which would then direct the user towards other pages. These sub files are nested inside of the main file, thus giving the functionality the website needs. This utilization of file placement is extremily significant to the organization of the website, and this specific file system is a perfect display of good organizational skills. The main reason for this file system being considered to be the best for use is due to the way the website will be built and how the links will direct to each other. The home page file will be directing users to other sub files, specifically the menu, music, and jobs files. It would be innapropriate to place every single file onto the same exact page, and would lead to an information overflow for the user, making readability become more difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
				2. Cite 3 design practices that have been well implemented. Cite 3 practices that could have been implemented in a better way. How else would you improve the website?
				</p>
				<p>
				I believe that if the links at the top of the screen were to match the color scheme, then this website would be much better looking in terms of physicality. Perhaps a color that matches the rest of the titles would suffice. The consistency was very fluid, despite this fact. The positioning of the images could possibly be made much larger to fit into the screen. The images on the website were to be far too small. The navigation links work in a splendid manner and color is being used everywhere. There is an overbearing amount of images or colors to distract the user from the page. One thing that the website needs is resizable functionalities, due to the fact that the browser resizes the images once the page is changed in size. I would change the background effect on the main section of the website. Perhaps, if the main section were to be surrounded by a dark, brown border, the styling would look a much better.
